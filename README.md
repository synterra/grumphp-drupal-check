# Description

This repository adds a task for GrumPHP that launchs [drupal-check](https://github.com/mglaman/drupal-check).
During a commit check Drupal code for deprecations and discover bugs via static analysis. If a deprecated code is detected, it won't pass.


# Installation

Install it using composer:

```composer require --dev metadrop/grumphp-drupal-check```


# Usage

1) Add the extension in your grumphp.yml file:
```yaml
extensions:
  - GrumphpDrupalCheck\ExtensionLoader
```

2) Add drupal check to the tasks:
```
tasks:
  drupalcheck:
    drupal_root: ~
    deprecations: true
    analysis: true
    php8: true
```
Optionally, you can define multiple DrupalCheck arguments:

- **drupal_root** (string): Configure the path to the Drupal root. This fallback option can be used if drupal-check could not identify Drupal root from the provided path(s). This is useful when testing a module as opposed to a Drupal installation.
- **deprecations** (boolean): Check code for deprecations. By default it is true.
- **analysis** (boolean): Check code analysis.
- **php8** (boolean): Set PHPStan phpVersion for 8.1 (Drupal 10 requirement).
